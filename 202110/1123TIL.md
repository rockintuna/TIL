## Jmeter 부하 테스트

Jmeter로 HTTP 테스트를 하면서 두 가지 리스너를 통해서 성능 정보를 추출했다.
참고 : https://kamang-it.tistory.com/398

모든 요청은 아래와 같은 Thread 설정을 통해 실행된다.

![image-20211124190838823](image-20211124190838823.png)

- **Number of Threads** : 쓰레드를 동시에 몇개 생성할지이다. 즉 동시에 몇개의 트랜잭션을 실행시킬지이다.
  이는 사람이 동시에 접속하는 효과를 낸다. 10명이서 동시에 접속하는 상황을 만들고 싶다면 10을 사용하면 된다.
- **Ramp-Up Period** : 쓰레드를 Ramp-Up Period시간동안 실행해라는 의미이다. 단 균등하게 시간을 나눠서 실행하려고 노력한다. 예를 들어 Nomber of Threads가 10인데 Ramp-Up Period가 60이면 10개의 쓰레드가 6초간격으로 동작하려고 한다. 근데 그렇게 안될 수도 있다.
- **Loop Count** : 스레드의 반복 횟수를 의미한다. 10이면 10번 반복한다. Infinite에 체크하면 무한 반복한다.



**Summary Report**

설정한 Http Request 별로 성능 데이터를 요약한다.

- 50개 유저에서 개별 HTTP 요청 100번 씩

**View Results in Table**

각 요청마다의 아웃풋을 확인할 수 있기 때문에 summary report 보다 상세하게 확인할 수 있다.
