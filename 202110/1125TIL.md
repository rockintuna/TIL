### org.hibernate.QueryException: query specified join fetching, but the owner of the fetched association was not present in the select list

QueryDSL 쿼리 프로젝션을 사용해서 Entity가 아닌 특정 클래스에 SQL로 조회한 데이터를 담으면서 발생한 에러이다.

```java
    @Override
    public List<RecommendationVo> searchByNumber(User login, int number) {
        return queryFactory
                .select(new QRecommendationVo(recommendation.type,
                        new QFollowVo(
                                user.username,
                                monsterDatabase.id,
                                monsterDatabase.imageUrl,
                                user.monsterCode,
                                new CaseBuilder()
                                        .when(follow.id.isNull())
                                        .then(Boolean.FALSE)
                                        .otherwise(Boolean.TRUE))
                        ))
                .from(recommendation).fetchJoin()
                .join(recommendation.user, user).fetchJoin()
                .join(user.monster, monster).fetchJoin()
                .join(monster.monsterDatabase, monsterDatabase)
                .leftJoin(follow)
                    .on(user.eq(follow.following)
                            .and(follow.follower.eq(login))
                    )
                .where(recommendation.number.eq(number))
                .fetch();
    }
```

RecommendationVo에 바로 담을 것이기 때문에 엔티티는 사용할 수 없다. 즉, 이 쿼리는 엔티티 그래프를 참조할 수 없는 쿼리이므로 fetch Join을 제거하고 순수한 join으로 변경하여 해결했다.
